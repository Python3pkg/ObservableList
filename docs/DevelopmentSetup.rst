Development Setup
=================

Make sure that you have the :ref:`repository installed
<installation-repository>`.

.. _development-setup-requirements:

Install Requirements
--------------------

To install all requirements for the development setup, execute

.. code:: bash

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt -r test-requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt

Sphinx Documentation Setup
--------------------------

Sphinx was setup using `the tutorial from readthedocs
<http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.
It should be already setup if you completed :ref:`the previous step
<development-setup-requirements>`.

Further reading:

- `domains <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html>`__

With Notepad++ under Windows, you can run the `make_html.bat
<https://github.com/niccokunzmann/ObservableList/blob/master/docs/make_html.bat>`__ file in the
``docs`` directory to create the documentation and show undocumented code.

Code Climate
------------

To install the code climate command line interface (cli), read about it in
their github `repository <https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate>`__
You need docker to be installed. Under Linux you can execute this in the 
Terminal to install docker:

.. code:: bash
    
    wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    
Then, log in and out. Then, you can install the command line interface:

.. code:: bash

    wget -qO- https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xvz
    cd codeclimate-* && sudo make install

Then, go to the ObservableList repository and analyze it.

.. code:: bash

    codeclimate analyze
    
Version Pinning
---------------

We use version pinning, described in `this blog post (outdated)
<http://nvie.com/posts/pin-your-packages/>`__.
Also read the `current version
<https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools>`__ for how to set up.

After installation you can run

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.in -r test-requirements.in -r dev-requirements.in
    pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in
    pip-compile --output-file test-requirements.txt test-requirements.in
    pip-compile --output-file dev-requirements.txt dev-requirements.in
    pip-sync requirements.txt dev-requirements.txt test-requirements.txt
    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt -r test-requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt

``pip-sync`` uninstalls every package you do not need and 
writes the fix package versions to the requirements files.

Continuous Integration to Pypi
------------------------------

Before you put something on `Pypi
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ObservableList>`__, ensure the following:

1. The version is in the master branch on github.
2. The tests run by travis-ci run successfully.

Pypi is automatically deployed by travis. `See here
<https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi>`__.
To upload new versions, tag them with git and push them.

.. code:: bash

  setup.py tag_and_deploy

The tag shows up as a `travis build
<https://travis-ci.org/niccokunzmann/ObservableList/builds>`__.
If the build succeeds, it is automatically deployed to `Pypi
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ObservableList>`__.

Manual Upload to the Python Package Index
-----------------------------------------


However, here you can see how to upload this package manually.

Version
~~~~~~~

Throughout this chapter, ``<new_version>`` refers to a a string of the form ``[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+[ab]?`` or ``<MAYOR>.<MINOR>.<STEP>[<MATURITY>]`` where ``<MAYOR>``, ``<MINOR>`` and, ``<STEP>`` represent numbers and ``<MATURITY>`` can be a letter to indicate how mature the release is.

1. Create a new branch for the version.

.. code:: bash

  git checkout -b <new_version>

2. Increase the ``__version__`` in `__init__.py <ObservableList/__init__.py#L3>`__

   - no letter at the end means release
   - ``b`` in the end means Beta
   - ``a`` in the end means Alpha

3. Commit and upload this version.

.. _commit:

.. code:: bash
  
  git add ObservableList/__init__.py
  git commit -m "version <new_version>"
  git push origin <new_version>

4. Create a pull-request.

5. Wait for `travis-ci <https://travis-ci.org/niccokunzmann/ObservableList>`__ to pass the tests.

6. Merge the pull-request.
7. Checkout the master branch and pull the changes from the commit_.

.. code:: bash

  git checkout master
  git pull

8. Tag the version at the master branch with a ``v`` in the beginning and push it to github.

.. code:: bash

  git tag v<new_version>
  git push origin v<new_version>

9. Upload_ the code to Pypi.
  

Upload
~~~~~~

.. Upload:

First ensure all tests are running:

.. code:: bash

    setup.py pep8


From `docs.python.org
<https://docs.python.org/3.1/distutils/uploading.html>`__:

.. code:: bash

    setup.py sdist bdist_wininst upload register

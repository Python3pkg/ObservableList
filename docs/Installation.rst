It can be installed form the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ObservableList>`__.

Install it with a specific python version under windows:

To install the version from the python package index, you can use your terminal and execute this under Linux:

If you wish to get latest source version running, you can check out the repository and install it manually.

  cd ObservableList
  sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  sudo python3 -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt

Same as under :ref:`installation-repository-linux` but you need to replace
``sudo python3`` with ``py -3``. This also counts for the following
documentation.
